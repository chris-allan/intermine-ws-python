    """
    A Class representing a structured database query
    ================================================

    Objects of this class have properties that model the
    attributes of the query, and methods for performing
    the request.

    SYNOPSIS
    --------

    example:

       >>> service = Service("http://www.flymine.org/query/service")
       >>> query = service.new_query()
       >>>
       >>> query.add_view("Gene.symbol", "Gene.pathways.name", "Gene.proteins.symbol")
       >>> query.add_sort_order("Gene.pathways.name")
       >>>
       >>> query.add_constraint("Gene", "LOOKUP", "eve")
       >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.pathways.name", "=", "Phosphate*")
       >>>
       >>> query.set_logic("A or B")
       >>>
       >>> for row in query.results():
       ...     handle_row(row)
    
    Query objects represent structured requests for information over the database
    housed at the datawarehouse whose webservice you are querying. They utilise 
    some of the concepts of relational databases, within an object-related 
    ORM context. If you don't know what that means, don't worry: you
    don't need to write SQL, and the queries will be fast.

    PRINCIPLES
    ----------
    
    The data model represents tables in the databases as classes, with records
    within tables as instances of that class. The columns of the database are the
    fields of that object::

      The Gene table - showing two records/objects
      +---------------------------------------------------+
      | id  | symbol  | length | cyto-location | organism |
      +----------------------------------------+----------+
      | 01  | eve     | 1539   | 46C10-46C10   |  01      |
      +----------------------------------------+----------+
      | 02  | zen     | 1331   | 84A5-84A5     |  01      |
      +----------------------------------------+----------+
      ...

      The organism table - showing one record/object
      +----------------------------------+
      | id  | name            | taxon id |
      +----------------------------------+
      | 01  | D. melanogaster | 7227     |
      +----------------------------------+
    
    Columns that contain a meaningful value are known as 'attributes' (in the tables above, that is 
    everything except the id columns). The other columns (such as "organism" in the gene table)
    are ones that reference records of other tables (ie. other objects), and are called 
    references. You can refer to any field in any class, that has a connection, 
    however tenuous, with a table, by using dotted path notation::

      Gene.organism.name -> the name column in the organism table, referenced by a record in the gene table

    These paths, and the connections between records and tables they represent,
    are the basis for the structure of InterMine queries.

    THE STUCTURE OF A QUERY
    -----------------------

    A query has two principle sets of properties:
      - its view: the set of output columns
      - its constraints: the set of rules for what to include

    A query must have at least one output column in its view, but constraints
    are optional - if you don't include any, you will get back every record
    from the table (every object of that type)

    In addition, the query must be coherent: if you have information about
    an organism, and you want a list of genes, then the "Gene" table
    should be the basis for your query, and as such the Gene class, which
    represents this table, should be the root of all the paths that appear in it:

    So, to take a simple example::
    
        I have an organism name, and I want a list of genes:

    The view is the list of things I want to know about those genes:

        >>> query.add_view("Gene.name")
        >>> query.add_view("Gene.length")
        >>> query.add_view("Gene.proteins.sequence.length")

    Note I can freely mix attributes and references, as long as every view ends in
    an attribute (a meaningful value). As a short-cut I can also write:

        >>> query.add_view("Gene.name", "Gene.length", "Gene.proteins.sequence.length")

    or:

        >>> query.add_view("Gene.name Gene.length Gene.proteins.sequence.length") 

    They are all equivalent.

    Now I can add my constraints. As, we mentioned, I have information about an organism, so:

        >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.organism.name", "=", "D. melanogaster")

    If I run this query, I will get literally millions of results - 
    it needs to be filtered further:

        >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.proteins.sequence.length", "<", 500)
    
    If that doesn't restrict things enough I can add more filters:

        >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.symbol", "ONE OF", ["eve", "zen", "h"])

    Now I am guaranteed to get only information on genes I am interested in. 

    Note, though, that because I have included the link (or "join") from Gene -> Protein,
    this, by default, means that I only want genes that have protein information associated 
    with them. If in fact I want information on all genes, and just want to know the 
    protein information if it is available, then I can specify that with:

        >>> query.add_join("Gene.proteins", "OUTER")

    And if perhaps my query is not as simple as a strict cumulative filter, but I want all 
    D. mel genes that EITHER have a short protein sequence OR come from one of my favourite genes 
    (as unlikely as that sounds), I can specify the logic for that too:

        >>> query.set_logic("A and (B or C)")

    Each letter refers to one of the constraints - the codes are assigned in the order you add
    the constraints. If you want to be absolutely certain about the constraints you mean, you
    can use the constraint objects themselves:

      >>> gene_is_eve = query.add_constraint("Gene.symbol", "=", "eve")
      >>> gene_is_zen = query.add_constraint("Gene.symbol", "=", "zne")
      >>>
      >>> query.set_logic(gene_is_eve | gene_is_zen)

    By default the logic is a straight cumulative filter (ie: A and B and C and D  and ...)

    Putting it all together:

       >>> query.add_view("Gene.name", "Gene.length", "Gene.proteins.sequence.length")
       >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.organism.name", "=", "D. melanogaster")
       >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.proteins.sequence.length", "<", 500)
       >>> query.add_constraint("Gene.symbol", "ONE OF", ["eve", "zen", "h"])
       >>> query.add_join("Gene.proteins", "OUTER")
       >>> query.set_logic("A and (B or C)")

    And the query is defined.

    Result Processing
    -----------------

    calling ".results()" on a query will return an iterator of rows, where each row 
    is a list of values, one for each field in the output columns (view) you selected.

    To process these simply use normal iteration syntax:

        >>> for row in query.results():
        ...     for column in row:
        ...         do_something(column)

    Here each row will have a gene name, a gene length, and a sequence length, eg:

        >>> print row
        ["even skipped", "1359", "376"]

    To make that clearer, you can ask for a dictionary instead of a list:

        >>> for row in query.result("dict")
        ...       print row
        {"Gene.name":"even skipped","Gene.length":"1359","Gene.proteins.sequence.length":"376"}

    Which means you can refer to columns by name:
        
        >>> for row in query.result("dict")
        ...     print "name is", row["Gene.name"]
        ...     print "length is", row["Gene.length"]

    If you just want the raw results, for printing to a file, or for piping to another program, 
    you can request strings instead:

        >>> for row in query.result("string")
        ...     print(row)


    Getting us to Generate your Code 
    --------------------------------

    Not that you have to actually write any of this! The webapp will happily
    generate the code for any query (and template) you can build in it. A good way to get
    started is to use the webapp to generate your code, and then run it as scripts
    to speed up your queries. You can always tinker with and edit the scripts you download.

    To get generated queries, look for the "python" link at the bottom of query-builder and
    template form pages, it looks a bit like this::

        Add a join statement to the query
        =================================

        example::

         query.add_join("Gene.proteins", "OUTER")

        A join statement is used to determine if references should
        restrict the result set by only including those references
        exist. For example, if one had a query with the view::
        
          "Gene.name", "Gene.proteins.name"

        Then in the normal case (that of an INNER join), we would only 
        get Genes that also have at least one protein that they reference.
        Simply by asking for this output column you are placing a 
        restriction on the information you get back. 
        
        If in fact you wanted all genes, regardless of whether they had  
        proteins associated with them or not, but if they did 
        you would rather like to know _what_ proteins, then you need
        to specify this reference to be an OUTER join::

         query.add_join("Gene.proteins", "OUTER")

        Now you will get many more rows of results, some of which will
        have "null" values where the protein name would have been,

        This method will also attempt to validate the join by calling
        Query.verify_join_paths(). Joins must have a valid path, the 
        style can be either INNER or OUTER (defaults to OUTER,
        as the user does not need to specify inner joins, since all
        references start out as inner joins), and the path

    A Class representing a predefined query
    =======================================

    Templates are ways of saving queries 
    and allowing others to run them 
    simply. They are the main interface
    to querying in the webapp

    SYNOPSIS
    --------

    example::

      service = Service("http://www.flymine.org/query/service")
      template = service.get_template("Gene_Pathways")
      for row in template.results(A={"value":"eve"}):
        process_row(row)
        ...

    A template is a subclass of query that comes predefined. They 
    are typically retrieved from the webservice and run by specifying
    the values for their existing constraints. They are a concise 
    and powerful way of running queries in the webapp.

    Being subclasses of query, everything is true of them that is true
    of a query. They are just less work, as you don't have to design each
    one. Also, you can store your own templates in the web-app, and then
    access them as a private webservice method, from anywhere, making them
    a kind of query in the cloud - for this you will need to authenticate
    by providing log in details to the service.

    The most significant difference is how constraint values are specified
    for each set of results.

        with Template.editable_constraints) and the values should be a dictionary
        of constraint properties to replace. You can replace the values for
        "op" (operator), "value", and "extra_value" and "values" in the case of 
        ternary and multi constraints.
